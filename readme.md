[http://csessig86.github.io/leaflet-markers-within-radius/](Live demo)

This demo shows how to calculate how many points are within a radius using [http://leafletjs.com/](Leaflet). It uses [http://jquery-geocodify.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](jquery-geocodify), which creates a form that allows readers to enter their address and have it plotted on the map.

To use, enter an address and then enter a radius. Under results will be the number of markers within the given radius. You can also drag the marker on the map; the number will update automatically.
